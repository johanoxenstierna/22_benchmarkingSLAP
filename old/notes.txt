1. Explain that NUM_VEH 9999999 is used to be extra clear about that it's a dynamicity version 1.
   This means that VEH_DEPOT_SECTION will not be provided for every vehicle, but e.g. juist 5 of them. If they run out
2. Depot locations can be hardcoded, just make sure obstacles aren't allowed to cross

TODO:
1. Build tsplib parser to validate that seed-generated instances are equivalent to ones generated by the yet to be
built tsplib-parser. Check solution of tsplib against distance matrix obtained by tsplib parser.
1. Investigate ortools-tsp CPU-time vs performance on instances.
1. Investigate grid-search SBI CPU-time vs performance on instances. Also check that solution quality moving average
stays on an equivalent level through optimization. This indicates that there is no room for "learning" which order to
select first.
